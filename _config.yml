title: Plotting Defoe's Adventure Novels
email: chenina @ sas.upenn.edu
description: >
  My research project was an emotion map of Daniel Defoeâ€™s adventure novels. The novels used were Robinson Crusoe (1719),
  Captain Singleton (1720), and Colonel Jack (1722). The map was meant to show the emotions associated with locations
  mentioned (not necessarily visited) in these books.
