## Introduction

My research project was an emotion map of Daniel Defoe’s adventure novels. The novels used were Robinson Crusoe (1719), Captain Singleton (1720), and Colonel Jack (1722). The map was meant to show the emotions associated with locations mentioned (not necessarily visited) in these books . The inspiration for this project was an emotion map created by Christian Nold. His maps represented the emotions, opinions and dialogue of the local population. The map was drawn from a pile of drawings made by the people in the city to portray their perception of the place they live in. I was fascinated by how he managed to combine this static and hyper-accurate medium with something as abstract and ambiguous as human emotions. I wanted to create something similar to Christian Nold’s map: a world map of the 18th-century drawn from the passages of Defoe’s novels.
